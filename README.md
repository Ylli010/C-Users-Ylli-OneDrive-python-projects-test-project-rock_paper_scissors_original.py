This program gives you the ability to play rock paper scissors with a friend.
Failure to answer with: rock, paper or scissors 3 times in a row will result into an automatic win for the opponents team.
Player 1 will be asked to play one of the 3 objects, afterwards the same question is asked to player 2.
If for example player 1 chooses rock and player 2 chooses paper, player 2 wins. 
So the rules in this program are the same as in reallife.
